There are a lot of technologies that go into making a website. It can be overwhelming to learn them all. I suggest starting with these three languages. Every website requires HTML. Every website you've ever seen has CSS. Every website also probably has Javascript.

Your task: find out the difference between these three lanuguages. Only one of them is a programming language. Google them if you don't know. Check out as many different links as you have to. Don't feel bad if you don't absorb it all at once. It may require several attempts before you fully understand what they are.
