* Create a [Github][github] account (free)
     * Github is a place to save your code online. It makes it easier to share projects and work together with other people on projects.
     * Git is a version control system that makes it easy to track your changes and work with other people on projects.
* Create a [cloud 9][c9] account (free)
    * make sure to use your github credentials
    * Cloud 9 is a free IDE in the browser. Don't know what an IDE is?... google it.
* Create a [Codeschool][codeschool]
    * Codeschool offers a lot of tutorials and exercises for you to work through. It's focus is on building websites. They have a few free tutorials that you can start out with but eventually you will want to move to the paid tier.

After you have completed these steps I recommend you start a tutorial in codeschool. 

We will also be creating a one page website in github pages.
