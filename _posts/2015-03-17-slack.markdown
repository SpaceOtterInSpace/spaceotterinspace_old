A cornerstone of becoming a good programmer is learning how to ask questions. Often times we cannot do this in a conversation as the person with the answer is only accessible online. Signing up for the slack channel will give you the opportunity to ask questions as you come accross them. So sign up. If you haven't gotten an invitation yet just request one.

**** Join the channel 'website-study-hall'

Also, there is a bot in some of the channels of the chatroom. Be nice to it or it will eat you up. If you go into a channel and type:
    witbot help
it will give you a list of commands it is capable of. Use your newfound power wisely.
