1. I missed a few meetings, can I still come?
* This, by far, is the most common question and the answer is... of course. The point of these meetups isn't to be a class where one follows lessons. It's a place for people to get together to study and have resources for help when they need it.

2. What can I work on?
* The short answer is... anything you want. The long answer is that I recommmend that everyone has a website to work on, so they at least have a place to try out the concepts they are learning about. If you have no idea what you want to try to work on then we certainly have suggestions that will work with the level you are at.
